* Enumeration Homework: Traveller

Learning Objectives
Be able to pass functions to higher-order functions
Be able to use built-in Array enumeration methods
Brief
You have been given a project with two models, Traveller and Journey, and their corresponding test files.

* A Journey has:

a start location
an end location
a mode of transport
a distance in miles

* A Traveller has:
an array of Journeys
You should write the code to make the Traveller tests pass, without modifying the spec files. You should use JavaScript’s built-in enumerator methods, only using forEach if you can’t find a way to use one of the other more appropriate methods.

*  MVP

* Traveller:

should have a collection of journeys
should be able to get the journeys start locations
should be able to get the journeys end locations
should be able to get journeys by transport
should be able to get journeys over a certain distance

* Extensions

* Traveller:

should be able to calculate total distance travelled
should be able to get a unique list of modes of transport
Note: Remember to remove the x from xit() on the pending tests to run them.

* Enumeration Homework

Learning Objectives
Be able to pass functions to higher-order functions
Be able to use built-in Array enumeration methods

Brief
You have been given four projects, each containing a coding problem. You should write the code to make the tests pass, without modifying the spec files. You should use JavaScript’s built-in enumerator methods where appropriate.

You should attempt to make your code as clean as possible. You don’t have to do all the work in the function that’s being called in the test. Don’t be afraid to attach little helper functions to the provided prototype.

Note: For now, make sure you use arrow functions for your callbacks to avoid problems with context. We will be looking more at the differences between function declaration types soon.

* UPPERCASER
map an array of strings to a new array containing uppercase versions of each string.

* Pangram Finder
A pangram is a sentence or phrase which contains every letter of the alphabet. “The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.” is probably the most notable pangram in English.

Given a sentence or phrase you should be able to determine whether or not every letter of the alphabet is included in it.

* Isogram Finder
An isogram is a word, phrase or sentence that does not contain any repeated letters. “Orange” is an isogram but “Banana” is not.

Given a word, phrase or sentence you should be able to determine whether or not it is an isogram. That is, you should be able to determine whether every letter is unique.

* Extension: Anagram Finder
An anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of another word. Listen is an anagram of silent, for example.

Given a word and an array of other words you should be able to filter the array, leaving only the anagrams of the word in question in the array.
